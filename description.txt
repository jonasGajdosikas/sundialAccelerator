Have you ever been waiting for your resouces to grow?
Have you ever wanted more use from the Enchanted Sundial?
Fret not, for this mod adds more usefulness to the sundial. You can use it to accelerate the gathering of naturally growing resources

Every time you craft something it adds 1 day to the sundial cooldown, craft too much and you will have to wait for the next day.

Currently craftable: 
    all types of wood in their respective biomes from acorns,
    chlorophyte from chlorophyte and mud,
    pumpkins from pumpkin seeds,
    naturally growing items in their respective places: 
        herbs only when they bloom, cacti, seashells, corals and starfish
Planned additions:
	Herb crafting compatibility with Thorium, Shadows of Abbadon and Spirit mod

Changelog:
	1.1.0.4 added icon
